          <p class="int">My name is Matt. I am a second year Information technology and managment
             major. I am interested in networking and the conecpt of cyber security. I am
             from northern Illinois. I have frequently been to Chicago throughout my life,
             so the city is not a new place for me, but it is a fun place to be close to.</p>

          <h3>Music</h3>
            <p class="int">I enjoy listening to rock, electronic, pop, and just generic music. If it
               is played on the radio, i'll most likely listen to it. My favorite band is
               a rock band named Alter Bridge.</p>

        <h3>Games</h3>
          <p class="int">I do play a decent amount of video games. I normally only play for a few hours
             a week. During school I am kept busy, but over school breaks and summer I do
             start to play games more often than I would. I play Overwatch most of the time.
             The only other games I play are mobile games.</p>
